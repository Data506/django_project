        Beyond my technical pursuits, I’ve also spent a significant part of my journey as a <strong>chess trainer and competitive chess player</strong>. This experience has sharpened my strategic thinking and taught me the value of patience, creativity, and resilience—qualities that directly influence my problem-solving approach in the data science field. Whether coaching students to enhance their gameplay or competing in tournaments myself, I’ve learned how to adapt quickly, analyze patterns under pressure, and craft winning strategies.
